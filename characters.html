        Dead By Daylight's roster of characters come from many different realms, even some familiar ones. In this page I will comment just a small portion of these characters as there are so many wonderful and terrifying characters in this game

    <div class="paragraphs">The Trapper is probably the most iconic character, specifically killer in Dead By Daylight, a slasher similar to the likes of Jason. The Trapper uses bear traps to corner and catch his prey and wears a chilling mask as he hooks the survivors to sacrifice to the Entity.  Evan Macmillian as he's a coal mine owner's son. The abuse from his father caused him to see the world in a twisted way. Now released from the servitude of his father, he follows a new master.</div>

    <h3 class="headings">Meg Thomas</h3>
    <img src="https://virtualgameinfo.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IconChar_meg.png" alt="Meg Thomas" class="images-small"/>
    <div class="paragraphs">Meg Thomas is one of the unlucky candidates for the Entity's trials in the fog. Meg is an athlete and a very good one at that, so she can easily evade and escape the killers deadly grasp unscathed. But if she does get injured, her overwhelming strive for survival pushes her body to the limits, meaning she can gain a second wind after being knocked down on the ground. If there was anything Meg's mother taught her, it was to always get back up. </div>
