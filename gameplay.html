      Dead By Daylights core gameplay is where 4 survivors try to escape a killer. To do this they must repair 5 generators total (watch out for quick time events!) and leave through one of the 2 exit gates. If only one survivor remains then there is an alternative exit called the hatch. For the killer, they must hunt and hook each survivor 3 times on a meat hook placed around the map, on the final hook the survivor will be sacrificed to the entity.

    <div class="paragraphs">
      Each survivor and killer is equipped with 3 teachable perks which they can use to gain the advantage in the trial, e.g. Sprint Burst allows the survivor to do a fast sprint when pressing the run key.
      The playground you have to survive/kill in is filled with lockers and wooden pallets used to either to hide from or create distance from the killer. There are also many different obstacles throughout to help escape the killer.
