    <div class="paragraphs">
      The Entity is a eternal being that cannot be described as in one form, its only want is to feed. And to do that it must sustain itself on the hopelessness of others. It stalks the many realms to find suitable prey and predators for its will and surrounds them in a consuming fog to transport them into a realm where they must fight to survive and if they do. They will only just get plunged into another. To many this is a hopeless purgatory, to us ist the Entity's Realm.

    <div class="paragraphs">
        To extract this hope the Entity must find monsters in realms outside its own to sacrifice these helpless survivors; it finds ruthless killers, whose right from wrong faded long ago and now only thirsts for bloodshed
